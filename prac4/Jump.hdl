/**
 * The jump unit determines whether the Program Counter should jump.
 * A jump is performed if any of the j1 j2 j3 bits of the c-instruction 
 * are true, AND the matching condition is met:
 *   j1: jump if ALU output is < 0
 *   j2: jump if ALU output   == 0
 *   j3: jump if ALU output is > 0
 * If multiple of these bits are set true, then jump if any of 
 * those conditions are met,
 * e.g. if j1 and j2 are both set true, jump if < 0 or == 0 
 * The ALU output is determined through the zr and ng wires:
 *   zr: is true when the ALU's output   == 0, false otherwise
 *   ng: is true when the ALU's output is < 0, false otherwise
 * If both zr and ng are false, then the ALU's output is > 0
